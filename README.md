# Developing a CRUD app using FAST API and Postgres

# Overview

This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python, and PostgreSQL, a powerful, open-source relational database system.

The application allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on a dataset stored in a PostgreSQL database. It provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records, offering a seamless experience for managing data through a RESTful API.

This project serves as a practical example of leveraging FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities and PostgreSQL's robust data management features to develop scalable and efficient web applications.
